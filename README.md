# SphereTriangulation
Two methods of triangulating a sphere are discussed. The first method uses spherical coordinates to triangulate a sphere in a longitude-latitude fashion. The second method uses octahedrons.
Moreover, calculating the solid angles of the spherical triangles, as well as the triangle centroids is discussed.
