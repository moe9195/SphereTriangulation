# SphereTriangulation
Two methods of triangulating a sphere are discussed. The first method uses spherical coordinates to triangulate a sphere in a longitude-latitude fashion. The second method uses octahedrons.
A method for calculating the solid angles of the spherical triangles is discussed and implemented. Moreover, a method to calculate the centroids of the spherical triangles is also discussed and implemented.
